# Solar-Power-Forecasting
This project is part of my final semester project work for M.Sc degree. The main scope and target here is to forecast annual solar power output from geographic locations from Asia (depends on data)  and then reduce the total soft cost incurred . The work is detailed in the documentation and project report provided below.
